# SaturnTrajSim
Simulation of the Trajectory of the Cassini Mission to Saturn and Beyond

This is a simulation built for my final year project, which can scan for and find interplanetary gravity assist trajectories for spacecraft. It allows a specific date and starting planet to be chose, and the system will scan through all available trajectories to find as many that get close to the target planet.

The sktfield library in Python allows for the accurate positions of the planets to be found at any given date in history or any date in the future. This is what is used to place the planets in their respective locations.

The final report PDF is also provided.
